##Description
During my first week at Sparta i began to construct my own Sparta Portfolio and learnt how to begin to code. We have just completed our first lab effort of our portfolio and this page will aim to shed light on the processes that were under use.

##Technologies

So far, these are some of the technologies I have learnt or am in the process of learning to use:

* The Terminal 
* HTML
* CSS
* GIT and advanced GIT
* Markdown
